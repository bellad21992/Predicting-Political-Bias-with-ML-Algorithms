# Predicting-Political-Bias-with-ML-Algorithms

To run the web app:
1. Download 'app.py', 'index.html', 'model.pkl', and 'tf.pkl'. Put all four of these files into the same folder, then put 'index.html' into it's own folder named "Templates". 
2. Run 'app.py' in Terminal by navigating to the folder where the files are located, and typing "python app.py" into the terminal.
3. Copy the link: "http://192.168.0.3:5000/" into your brower, and enter a URL of a political news article to predict its political leaning!
